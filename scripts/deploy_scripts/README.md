# Deployment scripts

This directory contains several scripts to assist in deployment of Drop protocol, `upload.bash` and `instantiate.bash`
are those you will need to run.

| Script                    | Purpose                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **upload_contracts.bash** | Stores wasm code of all Drop contracts on Neutron chain                                                             |
| **instantiate.bash**      | Creates instance of Drop protocol, waits until ICA addresses are registered and sets them in protocol configuration |
| utils.bash                | Universal library used across deployment scripts. You don't need to execute it by yourself                          |
| migrate.bash              | Simple script which migrates a single contract. Useful for development                                              |

## upload_contracts.bash

### Prerequisities

Before running upload, it is crucial to execute `make build` in root directory of the project. This action ensures
uploaded contracts will correspond to commit hash you are currently on.

### Configuration

Copy `.env.upload.example` to `.env.upload`, then configure it according to this table:

| Parameter           | Suggested testnet value                    | Suggested mainnet value                   | Description                                                                                           |

### Execution

```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' .env.upload | xargs) && ./upload_contracts.bash
```

After script is finished, please save its output, you will need it for `instantiate.bash`.

## instantiate.bash

### Configuration

Copy `.env.instantiate.example` to `.env.instantiate`, then configure it according to this 2 tables:

#### Cosmos SDK version

**TARGET_SDK_VERSION**. In order to configure factory you need to provide cosmos sdk version of the target network. You
can obtain by performing following command on the network current binary:

```
$ gaiad version --long | grep "cosmos_sdk_version"

cosmos_sdk_version: v0.47.10
```

or using REST service

```
curl -s -X 'GET' \
  'https://api-rs.cosmos.nodestake.top/cosmos/base/tendermint/v1beta1/node_info' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' | jq -r '.application_version.cosmos_sdk_version'

```

### Execution

```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' .env.instantiate | xargs) && ./instantiate.bash
```

During execution the script will print hermes commands. In case if it gets stuck, you will have to execute these hermes
commands manually until ICA account is registered.

After script is finished, write down its output, you will need it to configure frontend, monitoring and hermes.
